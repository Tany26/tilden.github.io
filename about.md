Let's be honest, no one likes badly designed user interfaces. However, in order to fix
the problems, you need to know <b>why</b> they're so bad. Over the course of my years as a CS major, HCI student, and professional UX engineer, I've been learning to do exactly that.

Right now, I'm working at [Sicom Systems, Inc](http://www.sicom.com), where I'm designing
software to make managing your fast food restaurant empire fun and exciting.
To get a better idea of the kinds of products I work on, check out the [Restaurant Management System redesign project](/projects/restaurant_management)!

<!-- In my spare time, I've built even more exciting projects, like JGA: Crossroads of Destiny. -->

My goal is to improve the world's user interfaces, one step at a time.
