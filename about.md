## Hi there!

I'm a UX designer with a multidisciplinary background -- this allows me to approach design from multiple perspectives, and even actualize my designs in the form of **functional prototypes**. My goal is to create designs that are **pleasant to use**; I believe that the best designs are those that you don't notice.

I began **web design** even before I got my degree in **Computer Science**, which led me to focus on **human-computer interaction** during graduate school. I realized then that what I was truly passionate about was design itself, thus leading to my current role as a **UX designer**. Right now, I'm working at [Sicom Systems](http://www.sicom.com), where I strive to make systems used in quick-serve restaurants easier to use. To get a better idea of the kinds of products I work on, check out the [Restaurant Management System redesign project](/projects/restaurant_management)!

I also enjoy [taking pictures](https://www.instagram.com/freakified/), and even co-author a [webcomic](http://www.scrapinold.com/23.html)! My greatest personal achievement is the creation of [JGA: Crossroads of Destiny](http://freakified.github.io/jga/), a complete video game, from scratch.
