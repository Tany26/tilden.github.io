## Hi there!

I'm a UX designer with a multidisciplinary background in Human-Computer Interaction and Computer Science! My goal is to slowly fix all those minor things that annoy you in the websites and apps you use every day. Currently, I work at [Indeed](https://www.indeed.com), where I'm trying to make finding a job slightly less stressful! 

I particularly enjoy working on side projects, like [my weird video game](/projects/jga) and one of the most popular [smartwatch faces for the Pebble (RIP)](/projects/timestyle).
