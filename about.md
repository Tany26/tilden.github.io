Let's be honest, no one likes badly designed user interfaces. However, in order to fix
the problems, you need to know know <b>why</b> it's so bad. Over the course of my years as a CS major, HCI student, and professional UX engineer I've been learning to do exactly that.

Right now, I'm working at [Sicom Systems, Inc](http://www.sicom.com), where I'm designing
software to make managing your fast food restaurant empire fun and exciting.
To get a better idea of the kinds of products I work on, check out [Drive-Thru Monitor](/projects/drivethru/)
and [Production Control](/projects/productioncontrol)!

My goal is to improve the world's user interfaces, one step at a time.
