**How it should work**

So here's my scenario:

I'm watching a video, and I see an interesting video in the "related videos" sidebar. I'd sure like to watch it, but I also want my current video to finish! What do to? I should be able to click on the "watch later" button, and then have it go into some kind of queue area where it remembers that I want to watch that video next!

_wait didn't youtube used to do this?_

Yes! But poorly. See, for a while, you'd click watch later, and this strip representing your watch later playlist would pop up on the bottom of the screen and your new video would appear in there. HOWEVER! When your current video ended, that was still it. You had to manually _start_ the watch later playlist, even though it was this weird persistent thing on the bottom! Crazy, huh?
