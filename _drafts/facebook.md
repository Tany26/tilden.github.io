# Permission Abuse: How Facebook for Android showcases the sad state of privacy on android

I think android is great; I really do! Apps have a lot less restrictions than they do on both iOS and Windows Phone, which allows for apps that do cool things that you really couldn't have on other platforms. Some examples:

* Lux, which allows you to specify your own auto-brightness settings, or even use the camera for brightness determination
* Alternative alarm clock apps, like the awesome Timely (note that these are possible on other platforms, but are unable to wake the phone up so you have to leave the app running in the foreground)
* Interesting multi-tasking UIs, such as the new web browser Link Bubble or Facebook Messenger's Chat Heads (which link bubble basically copied the UI from)
* Alternatives to other system apps that can perform just as well as built-in ones, like alternate web browsers (Firefox), alternate dialers, and even alternate keyboards!

And more! So we can see that Android's permissive model allows for some really cool app innovation that we don't really see on other platforms.
