    Let's be honest, no one likes badly designed user interfaces. However, it's not just
    knowing that a user interface is bad -- you have to know <i>why</i> it's bad, and
    how to fix it.
    I am passionate about both aesthetics and usability; it is my belief that the two are inextricably
    linked.  My goal is to apply these values to the worldâ€™s software.
