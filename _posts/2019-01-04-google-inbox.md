Google announced that 2019 would be the last year Inbox would exist. Never heard of Inbox? Not surprising. It always occupied sort of a weird position in Google's pantheon of products. It perhaps could be best described as an alternative UI for GMail, which represented the product's future. 

It doesn't really make a whole lot of sense for Google to maintain two separate interfaces for their flagship email product, so of course they'd kill Inbox. But I'm very upset about this, because the "future" that Inbox represented was, in my view, the greatest email client ever designed, and the legacy Gmail product has never been able to live up to the greatness that Inbox was (and, as of this writing still is. that won't last much longer though, if Google sticks to their unfortunate timeline.)

## Why Inbox is Great
	• Reasons it's good:
		○ inbox is task based
		○ inbox addresses the "e-mail to yourself" task in a much more elegant way
		○ "unread" actually means unread
		○ Automatic trip grouping
		○ Automatic other grouping

### "Flow" style of email visualization

Gmail requires a context switch every time you click an email. You're in the list, now you're in the email! Go back and...where were you again?

Now, many e-mail clients try to mitigate this by using multiple panes. Even Gmail itself can do this, if you enable the "two-pane" option in the settings! Problem solved, right? 

Except that I would argue that Inbox's approach is still superior. By clever use of animation, it remains consistently clear where you are in the flow at all times.

They even apply this logic to folders, using "Bundles". By grouping related emails into a single top-level heading, you once again can always retain your mental position. Furthermore, bundles don't exist as a strange separate entity from emails like folders do:

### Task-based email

Inbox is designed around the idea that emails represent tasks, and you clear them out of your inbox when you're done with them. This was initally popularized by the [MailPilot](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1380180715/mail-pilot-email-reimagined) startup way back in 2010, though it has never really made inroads into mainstream email clients, with the sole execption of Google's Inbox product.

#### Proper inbox zero support

A key tenet of task-based email is the concept of "inbox zero" [todo: cite], in which your goal is to get to zero messages in your inbox. (This, ideally, would mean you have completed all your tasks). Inbox has a nice state for this, whereas Gmail shows a  list of Hangouts chats for some reason:

#### Unread Actually means unread

Okay this is a really minor one, but people often use "unread" to mean like "i need to act upon this". Is that what is says? No, you're using email wrong. Inbox FIXES this by not allowing you to set messages as unread. if the message has been unread, it's read. end of story. quit being dumb, everyone.

### Amazing Automatic Categorization

Tying in with the bundling thing above, Inbox can use Gmail's same Social/Promotions/Finance groupings, but without Gmails _completely terrible_ tab UI. 

Furthermore, it offers the Trip bundles, which continue to be unlike anything else on the market. The cloest thing is TripIt, a service which, while functional, requires that you forward all your travel emails to it manually and looks like it's a leftover from 2011.



	• Reasons it's bad
		○ "Bundle" functionality breaks down if you have more than 25 messages (that is, if you don't follow "inbox zero" religiously)
		○ Search function doesn't really work
		○ Bundles make archive browsing tedious
        ○ Inbox isn't for everyone -- it has particular expectations about how you handle email, and if you don't handle them "the inbox way" it breaks down.

	• Reasons Gmail is bad
		○ Weird legacy cruft
			§ giant pile of text buttons
			§ fails to handle "inbox zero" in a meaningful way
			§ no transition animations
			§ horrible tab system is far worse than inbox's bundles


	• Would it have been possible for Inbox to replace Gmail?
		○ Yes, but it would have required work to make Inbox able to support "less inboxy" workflows
		○ Alternatively, inbox features could be brought to gmail, which is ostensibly what google is doing, though they are awful
			
			
	• How GMail could integrate in Inbox features
		○ Three key things:
			§ Proper "Inbox Zero" state (right now gmail just shows a pile of chats and it doesn't really give you much sense of satisfaction)
