Back in 2010, YouTube introducted a "watch later" button to videos [^watchlaterintroduction]. This button, when pressed, adds the video to a special playlist. While the playlist has changed over the years, the fuction of it remains the same: it stores the videos you've added it to track of which videos in it you've watched vs not watched.
