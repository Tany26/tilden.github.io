      <h3>Production. Under control.</h3>
      <small>
        To ensure that your customers are served in a timely fashion, you'll need to keep food on-hand at all times.
        However, you can't just leave that cooked food indefinitely -- it'll go bad! And how many burgers should you cook, anyway?
        <br /><br />
        Production control takes care of all this and more via a touch-friendly tablet-inspired UI.

    <h3>Burgers don't last forever.</h3>
    After being cooked, burgers are typically placed in heated holding pans, where their time becomes limited.
    Production Control displays each holding unit in a way that closely maps to their physical layout.
    <br /><br />
    For each pan, Production Control displays the time and quantity remaining, which
    pans should be used first, and which have expired. Secondary cues based on lightness and pattern accomodate colorblind users.

    <h3>Cook with confidence.</h3>
    Using data from past sales, Production Control automatically suggests what to cook, and can automatically compensate for unexpectedly large orders.

  <small>Like <a href="/projects/drivethru">Drive-Thru Monitor</a>, Production Control will soon be deployed by a major restaurant chain at thousands of locations throughout the United States,
  so look out for it at a restaurant near you!</small>
