      <h3>A massive undertaking for a sprawling system...</h3>
      <small>
        In use at over 7,000 restaurants worldwide, the Restaurant Management System was an unqualified success.
        However, as it had grown in popularity, it had also grown in features, slowly evolving into sprawling mess of interconnected pages.
        <br /><br />
        Redesigning such a system from the ground up would be no easy task, so we decided
        to team up with an external team of usability professionals with experience in the industry.

    <h3>Deconstructing and reconstructing the system</h3>
    <small>
      Before design of the new system could begin, we undertook a project to understand the
      existing system in detail.
      <br /><br />
      Starting with an expert review of the existing system and continuing into interviews
      with both users and stakeholders, our team produced several documents.
