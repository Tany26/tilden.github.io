      <h3>Real-Time, Digestible Data</h3>
      <small>
      Drive-Thru Monitor is focused on conveying the information your employees need without overwhelming them
      with numerical statistics.
      <br /><br />
      A simple bar graph compares the current average drive-thru service times with a pre-selected goal time, and bubbles placed
      near the cars quickly convey exactly how long each car has been waiting.

    <h3>Your restaurant. Not someone else's.</h3>
    Unlike other drive-thru monitoring systems on the market, which use highly abstract representations
    of road layouts, Drive-Thru Monitor uses visuals designed based on aerial views of actual drive-thrus.
    <br /><br />
    Because of this, whether your restaurant has parallel order areas, a separate payment area, or even
    is located a country where people drive on the left, Drive-Thru Monitor supports layout.

      Drive-Thru Monitor features video-game inspired visuals, including animated car motion and a real-time day/night cycle.
