      <h3>Real-Time, Digestible Data</h3>
      <small>
      Drive-Thru Monitor is designed to convey the state of a restaurant's drive-thru without
      overwhelming users with numerical statistics.
      <br /><br />
      A simple bar graph compares the current average drive-thru service times with a pre-selected goal time, and bubbles attached
      to the car graphics convey how long each car has been waiting.

    <h3>Spatially Mapped to Your Drive-Thru</h3>
    In lieu of the highly abstract representations (such as a simple list of times)
    found in competing solutions, I designed Drive-Thru Monitor using aerial views of actual drive-thrus as a basis.

      <h3>Always in Motion</h3>
      Drive-Thru Monitor features video-game inspired visuals, including animated car motion and a real-time day/night cycle.
      <br /><br />
      To illustrate the motion, I created this animated mockup using CSS animation, SVG, and HTML.

      dropped for several reasons, namely that it did not provide room for many cars.

      Once it was determined that the hardware would be mounted directly above the drive-thru window,
      we changed the orientation of the virtual road to match.
