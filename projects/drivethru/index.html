      <h3>Real-Time, Digestible Data</h3>
      <small>
      Drive-Thru Monitor is designed to convey the state of a restaurant's drive-thru without
      overwhelming users with numerical statistic.
      <br /><br />
      A simple bar graph compares the current average drive-thru service times with a pre-selected goal time, and bubbles attached
      to the car graphics convey how long each car has been waiting.

    <h3>Maps to Each Restaurant's Actual Drive-Thru Layout</h3>
    Unlike other drive-thru monitoring systems on the market, which use highly abstract representations
    of road layouts, Drive-Thru Monitor uses configurable visuals based on aerial views of actual drive-thrus.
