Welcome to the world of **JGA: Crossroads of Destiny**. In this story-driven RPG, you play as an exiled infomercial chef who must embrace his destiny
and restore balance to the world. For this project, I composed an **original soundtrack**,
drew in-game **artwork**, wrote a **45-page script**, and **coded the entire game** using Unity.

## Introduction

Long ago, I had created a game for my younger brother as a Christmas present, starring him as the protagonist. Only taking about 10-15 minutes to play through, it included a bizarre storyline involving flying basketballs, a J-shaped fortress, and lots of plot holes. For years, I had planned a sequel to the game--one which would finally explain *everything*--but each time I was met with nothing but false starts. Until I finally sat down one day and decided that the time had come. I would create the game I had been planning for nearly a decade.

Perhaps the largest issue with the game's protracted planning period was the sheer number of abstract ideas involved: I had concepts based on RPGs, platformers, and even sports games. I had even, at one point, created graphical assets for a 3D version of the game that never made it past the prototype phase. It was clear that in order to start development, I needed to simplify the game.

## Focusing on Development

I began by writing up a simple outline of the proposed game's content. I stripped it down to the most basic elements: the characters, their motivations, and their journeys. I then started building the graphical assets I would need for each chapter in the story.

Screenplay-based cutscene system makes it easy to include long-winded expository dialog sequences.
