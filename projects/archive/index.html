		I worked with Sicom to redesign the Sicom Enterprise Management System,
		a tool allowing companies to manage and analyze hundreds of restaurants at once.
		<br />
		<br />
		After the refresh, an internal survey conducted by a major restaurant chain
		found that SEMS went from being the lowest ranked enterprise tool to the highest.

		up local waterways. Replaced static webpage with one powered by Drupal, which included
		writing a custom theme and plugin to replace all club e-mail-based workflows.

		<br /><br />
		This is my design for my high school's latin club (pretty good by 2004 standards,
		wouldn't you say?) In true early-days-of-CSS fashion, I even threw in
		a <i>theme switcher</i>. Woah.
