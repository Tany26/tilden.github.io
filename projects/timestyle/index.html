		<h3>Your new default watchface</h3>
      Designed to blend perfectly with the aesthetic defined by the Pebble watch's "timeline" interface, TimeStyle offers
      unprecedented style and customizability.
      <br><br>
      In addition, unlike almost all other Pebble digital watchfaces, the time is displayed using antialiasing.

	<h3>Designing TimeStyle</h3>
	<small>
    When I got a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/597507018/pebble-time-awesome-smartwatch-no-compromises?ref=users">Pebble Time watch</a>,
     I found that, among all the various watchfaces available,
    none of them really matched the rest of the watch's aesthetic: the timeline.
  </small>
  <br>
  <small>
    The &ldquo;timeline&rdquo; is a UI introduced for the Pebble Time that visualizes <b>past</b> and <b>future</b> events,
    called &ldquo;pins&rdquo;, with the watch's face serving as the <b>present</b>.
    Pins can include weather, alarms, and calendar events:
    <br /><br />
  </small>
  <img class="screenshot" width="450" height="350" src="timeline_ex.png" alt="Graph showing several pages' access data" /><br />
  <br />
  <small>
    While the current watchface serves to visualize the <b>present</b>, no watchfaces available looked
    anything like the timeline; I felt that an ideal watchface should feel like <b>part of the timeline</b>.
    To elaborate, I wanted my watchface to be:
  </small>
    <small>
    <h4>Consistent:</h4>
    Match the Pebble Time's design language as closely as possible
    </small>
    <small>
    <h4>Readable:</h4>
    The time should be large enough to be readable in even low-light conditions
    </small>
    <small>
    <h4>Stylish:</h4>
    Given that a watch is something you wear, it should look nice
    </small>
    <small>
    <h4>Informative:</h4>
    Like the timeline, I wanted to include about the present, including the weather day, month, and date.

    Building upon this last concept, I switched to a thinner font and dropped the AM/PM indication. I composited
    this element into an official press photo of the Pebble Time, and posted this mockup to
    <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2138543-Pebble-Time-Watchface-Concept">Dribbble</a>
    and Reddit:<br><br>

    On Reddit, the response was extremely positive, with the mockup becoming one of the 25 most highly voted posts of all time on <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/pebble">r/pebble</a>.)
    However, with this popularity came something I didn't anticipate -- customization requests!

    I had people asking for all different colors schemes, the ability to build custom themes, the ability to show battery life, and tons of other features. I didn't want to let them down -- after all, I wanted to take advantge of the crazy response I had gotten. However, adding the level of customization required would prove challenging to implement.

      A key challenge in building this face was antialiasing the digits. While the Pebble Time's screen is technically capable of displaying text with AA (it has 64 colors), the software will only ever render text with jagged edges. This results in essentially every digital watchface having unpleasantly pixellated text. Early on, I decided that I wanted to include text-AA, and had planned to just bake it in by using pre-rendered digits. However, that was thrown into question with all the requests for customizability -- how could I use images for the text if the background color and text color were customizable?
<br><br>
The answer, it turned out, was by using palette swapping to dynamically alter the images in memory. Each digit image has four colors: white (the background), black (the foreground), and two intermediate shades of grey. On the watch itself, TimeStyle swaps white with the user's chosen background color, swaps black with the user's chosen foreground color, and averages the R, G, and B components of each color to determine the two closest intermediate colors that the Pebble Time's display can show.

      My efforts to satisfy potential user requests proved worthwhile -- as of only two weeks
      following its release, it had already garnered over 850 "hearts" and more than 10,000 installations, placing it among the most popular color watch faces of all time!

      Maybe include something from twitter?
