		<h3>Your new default watchface</h3>
      Designed to blend perfectly with the aesthetic defined by the Pebble watch's "timeline" interface, TimeStyle offers
      unprecedented style and customizability.
      <br><br>
      Unlike almost all other Pebble digital watchfaces, the time is displayed using antialiasing.
      Finally, TimeStyle is completely <a href="https://github.com/freakified/TimeStylePebble">open source</a>.

	<h3>Designing TimeStyle</h3>
	<small>
    When I got a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/597507018/pebble-time-awesome-smartwatch-no-compromises?ref=users">Pebble Time watch</a>,
     I found that, among all the various watchfaces available,
    none of them really matched the rest of the watch's aesthetic: the timeline.
  </small>
  <br>
  <small>
    The &ldquo;timeline&rdquo; is a UI introduced for the Pebble Time that visualizes <b>past</b> and <b>future</b> events,
    called &ldquo;pins&rdquo;, with the watch's face serving as the <b>present</b>.
    Pins can include weather, alarms, and calendar events:

  <img class="screenshot" width="450" height="350" src="timeline_ex.png" alt="Example of how TimeStyle matches the Pebble's Timeline interface" /><br />
  <br />
  <small>
    While the current watchface serves to visualize the <b>present</b>, no watchfaces available looked
    anything like the timeline; I felt that an ideal watchface should feel like <b>part of the timeline</b>.

    Building upon this last concept, I switched to a thinner font and dropped the AM/PM indication. Compositing
    this into an official press photo of the Pebble Time, I posted the following mockup to
    <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2138543-Pebble-Time-Watchface-Concept">Dribbble</a>
    and Reddit:<br><br>

    On Reddit, the response was extremely positive, with the mockup becoming one of the 25 most highly voted posts of all time on <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/pebble">r/pebble</a>.
    <br><br>
    However, with this popularity came something I didn't anticipate -- customization requests!
    People were asking for all sorts of features; I didn't want to let them down, but
    adding the level of customization required would prove challenging to implement.

  <h3>Implementation</h3>
  <small>
    Like all Pebble watchfaces, TimeStyle was written in pure C.<br><br>
  A key challenge I faced was antialiasing the digits. While the Pebble Time's screen is technically
   capable of displaying text with AA, the software does not support it.
Early on, I had wanted to include text-AA, and had planned to just bake it in by using images for the digits.
 However, that was thrown into question with all the requests for customizability -- how could I use images for the text if the background color and text color were customizable?

  <div>
    <img class="screenshot" src="palswap.png" width="400" height="230" alt="Illustration of palette swapping process" />
  </div>
  <div class="pic_desc">
My solution was to use palette swapping: each digit image has four colors: white (the background), black (the foreground), and two intermediate shades of grey.
Black and white are replaced with the user's chosen foreground background colors, and the R, G, and B components of these colors are averaged to determine the two closest intermediate colors.

	<h3>Release</h3>
	<div class="pic_desc">
    <small>
      My efforts to satisfy the various user requests proved worthwhile -- within only two weeks
      of its release, TimeStyle had already become one of the top 15 most popular color
      watchfaces of all time, garnering over 880 &ldquo;hearts&rdquo; and more than 10,000 installations.

      It was even featured in the Pebble app store:<br><br>
